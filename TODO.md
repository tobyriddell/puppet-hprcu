- [x] enhance gen_hprcu_type.rb so that it accepts input and output file names, and can also act as a filter (i.e. use '-' for stdin and/or stdout
- [x] bring README.md up to date wrt. property values (i.e. no longer any need for them to be munged)
- [x] add copyright
- [x] add option to control creation of flag file
- [x] add configurable path tp hprcu binary (with sensible defaults)
- [x] update README with info. re. flagfile
- [ ] update README with info. re. hprcu binary path
- [ ] add documentation on type/provider (@doc)
- [ ] add error-checking when opening files
- [ ] enhance command-line arguments supported by gen_hprcu_type.rb to allow naming of the type that it creates (this allows a type named per-BIOS revision - different BIOS revisions have different names for settings, and hence may need a type that supports the various names)
- [ ] when checking path to flag file, use 'absolute'
